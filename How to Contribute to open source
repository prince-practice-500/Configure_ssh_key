g. In that, choose the account/branches wisely before clicking on "Create Pull Request". ( Just don't blindly click on "Create Pull Request").
h. And that's it. PR is raised and this PR will be visible to author.


You'll be wondering, why we forked it in step a.
Because you can't directly raise the PR for other's repro. That's why, we forked it first.
